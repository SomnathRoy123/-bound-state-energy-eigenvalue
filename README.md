# -bound-state-energy-eigenvalue
 H_2 molecule has a gamma = 21.7, while for O_2, gamma is 150. Finding bound state energy eigenvalues for these two molecules
 
 Semi-classical quantization and energy eigenvalues: Consider a bound particle executing periodic motion in a potential V (r). For such a particle, we have,
$$E=\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(r)$$ or $$p(r) = \pm[2m(E − V(r))]^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
A periodic motion indicates a closed phase space trajectory. To quantize the motion, and hence obtain approximations
to the eigenvalues En appearing in the energy expression above, we consider the dimensionless action at a given energy,
$$S(E) = \oint k(r) \,dr$$
where $k(r) = \hbar^{−1}p(r)$ is the local de Broglie wave number and the integral is over one complete cycle of oscillation.
